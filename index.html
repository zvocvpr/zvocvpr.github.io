                  We introduce ZeroVO, a novel visual odometry (VO) algorithm that achieves zero-shot generalization across diverse cameras and environments, overcoming limitations in existing methods that depend on predefined or static camera calibration setups. Our approach incorporates three main innovations. First, we design a calibration-free, geometry-aware network structure capable of handling noise in estimated depth and camera parameters. Second, we introduce a language-based prior that infuses semantic information to enhance robust feature extraction and generalization to previously unseen domains. Third, we develop a flexible, semi-supervised training paradigm that iteratively adapts to new scenes using unlabeled data, further boosting the models' ability to generalize across diverse real-world scenarios. We analyze complex autonomous driving contexts, demonstrating over 30% improvement against prior methods on three standard benchmarks, KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2, as well as a newly introduced, high-fidelity synthetic dataset derived from Grand Theft Auto (GTA). By not requiring fine-tuning or camera calibration, our work broadens the applicability of VO, providing a versatile solution for real-world deployment at scale.

            <p class="my-paragraph">
            Our method facilitates generalization via minimal and versatile image-based priors, integrated throughout our model structure. Given a pair of input images, our model computes a rich multimodal embedding through a transformer-based fusion module. The embedding is then passed to a two-branch decoder MLP that outputs realworld translation and rotation. Our architecture leverages cross-attention to fuse complementary cues, including flow, depth,
            camera intrinsics, and language-based features in a geometry-aware manner. The language prior is first used to refine both the depth map
            and 2D flow estimates. The refined depth is then unprojected into 3D (using estimated parameters) to compute scene flow, which is further
            enhanced and fused with additional features before decoding. By embedding geometric reasoning and multimodal priors directly into the
            network structure, our model achieves strong zero-shot generalization across diverse and challenging settings.

            <b>Comparative Analysis Across Datasets.</b> 
            We compare ZeroVO variants with existing baselines using standard metrics of translation, rotation, absolute trajectory, and scale errors. All methods are provided with estimated camera intrinsics and metric depth. ZeroVO+ is
            our model trained with further data using semi-supervision, and LiteZeroVO+ is a smaller model variant for resource-constrained settings.
            Our models demonstrate strong performance across metrics and datasets, particularly in metric translation estimation. As highlighted by
            the scale error, GTA and nuScenes contain challenging evaluation settings, including nighttime, weather variations, haze, and reflections.
            We note that TartanVO and DPVO baselines (in gray) only predict up-to-scale motion and use privileged information, i.e., ground-truth
            scale alignment in evaluation.

          The image depicts a driving scenario where a vehicle is traveling on a dirt road that cuts through a landscape dominated by wind turbines. The road appears to be unpaved and dusty, suggesting it might be a rural or remote area. The wind turbines are tall and white, with multiple blades that are likely designed to capture wind energy. The sky is clear and blue, indicating good weather conditions. The terrain is hilly with sparse vegetation, and the overall setting suggests a location that is likely used for renewable energy production.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 italic w-full">
          The image depicts a driving scenario in a forested area. The road appears to be unpaved and is surrounded by tall trees, suggesting a rural or remote location. There is a layer of fog or mist that is rising from the ground, which could indicate recent rain or damp conditions. The lighting suggests it might be either early morning or late afternoon, as the sky is not brightly lit, and the shadows are long. The overall atmosphere is serene and somewhat mysterious due to the fog and the quiet, natural setting.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 italic w-full">
          The image depicts a driving scenario on a narrow, unpaved road that appears to be winding along a cliff edge. The road is not well-maintained, with visible tire tracks and loose gravel, suggesting that it is frequently used by vehicles. The cliff on the left side of the road is steep and rocky, with sparse vegetation growing along the edge. The sky is overcast, and the lighting suggests it could be either early morning or late afternoon. The overall atmosphere is one of a rugged, possibly remote location, and the road seems to be a challenge for drivers.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 italic w-full">
          In the image, we see a driving scenario where a black convertible car is stopped at a traffic light. The car is positioned on the right side of the road, as indicated by the traffic light and the road markings. The traffic light is displaying a red signal, indicating that the car must stop. The car’s brake lights are on, and the driver appears to be waiting for the light to change before proceeding. There are buildings on both sides of the street, and the architecture suggests a mix of commercial and residential structures. The road is marked with a crosswalk, and there are traffic signs visible, including one that reads 'DO NOT BLOCK INTERSECTION,' which is likely there to prevent vehicles from stopping in a way that could obstruct traffic flow. The overall scene is typical of an urban environment where traffic rules are enforced, and drivers are expected to follow the signals and signs to ensure the smooth flow of traffic and pedestrian safety.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 italic w-full">
          The image depicts a driving scenario on a highway during what appears to be a rainy day. The road is wet, reflecting the light, and there are multiple lanes with vehicles traveling in both directions. The vehicles include a black car in the foreground, which is the main focus of the image, and other cars in the background. The highway is bordered by a barrier on the right side, and there are trees and a hillside on the left side, suggesting a coastal or hilly region. Above the highway, there is a bridge or overpass with a green sign that is not clearly legible. The sky is overcast, and the lighting suggests it could be either dawn or dusk. The overall atmosphere of the image is somewhat moody and atmospheric, with a focus on the motion of the vehicles and the wet road conditions.

        <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 italic w-full">
          The image depicts a nighttime driving scenario on a road that appears to be wet, possibly due to recent rain. The visibility is reduced, and the atmosphere is dark, with the streetlights casting a glow on the wet surface. There are several vehicles on the road, including a blue and yellow taxi in the foreground, a white bus in the background, and other cars in between. The vehicles are moving along the road, and the traffic seems to be flowing, albeit at a slower pace due to the wet conditions. The road is bordered by a barrier on the left side, and there are palm trees lining the right side, suggesting a location that could be in a region with a warm climate. The overall scene is typical of a city street during a rainy evening, with the challenge of navigating through the reduced visibility and wet road conditions.
